/* 
  
  A servo is activated by creating an instance of the Servo class passing the desired pin to the attach() method.
  The servos are pulsed in the background using the value most recently written using the write() method

  Note that analogWrite of PWM on pins associated with the timer are disabled when the first servo is attached.
  Timers are seized as needed in groups of 12 servos - 24 servos use two timers, 48 servos will use four.
  The sequence used to sieze timers is defined in timers.h

  The methods are:

   Servo - Class for manipulating servo motors connected to Arduino pins.

   attach(pin )  - Attaches a servo motor to an i/o pin.
   attach(pin, min, max  ) - Attaches to a pin setting min and max values in microseconds
   default min is 544, max is 2400  
 
   write()     - Sets the servo angle in degrees.  (invalid angle that is valid as pulse in microseconds is treated as microseconds)
   writeMicroseconds() - Sets the servo pulse width in microseconds 
   read()      - Gets the last written servo pulse width as an angle between 0 and 180. 
   readMicroseconds()   - Gets the last written servo pulse width in microseconds. (was read_us() in first release)
   attached()  - Returns true if there is a servo attached. 
   detach()    - Stops an attached servos from pulsing its i/o pin.
